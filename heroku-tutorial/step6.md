# Auto-deploying
Now that we know how to use Heroku CLI to create, deploy, and manage our app, it's time to set up an auto-deploy feature by connecting Heroku to GitHub.
In order to get this to work, you must connect your github account to your Heroku account. Sadly, at the time of writing this tutorial, this is currently disabled as Heroku has experienced security issues related to this feature. However, we will still show you how to go about setting this up for when they resolve their issues!

This can be done entirely on your browser. Firstly log in to Heroku and navigate to your app.

In the deploy section of your app, choose GitHub. This will show you alternatives for using github to deploy your app.

At this stage you will have to connect your Heroku account to your GitHub account by pressing "Connect to GitHub" as illustrated in the image.
